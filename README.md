# What is an "Intro Screen?"
Larger streamers often have a ~1 hour period at the start of their stream where they wait for their regular viewers to make their way to the stream before starting the "main event".

In this context, an intro screen is a fun, procedural animation that integrates the viewers by including their emotes as well. They can also be a fun way to showcase art from the streamers community, or be themed to the event or topic at-hand so that all the viewers immediately know what's scheduled after the intro period.
