# Twitch Chat Animations!

(It doesn't have to be twitch, they just have a lot of fun emotes) This is a project for creating fun animations that live streamers can use to make their streams a touch more visually appealing and interactive. The concept is simple, use JavaScript to create an animation that connects to Twitch Chat and displays emotes in real time using fun animations. The end result is a browser source streamers can easilly plug into OBS!

Some helpful tips on the visual and technical composition.

## What is an "Intro Screen?"

Larger streamers often have a ~1 hour period at the start of their stream where they wait for their regular viewers to make their way to the stream before starting the "main event".

In this context, an intro screen is a fun, procedural animation that integrates the viewers by including their emotes as well. They can also be a fun way to showcase art from the streamers community, or be themed to the event or topic at-hand so that all the viewers immediately know what's scheduled after the intro period.
